# Sell Products & Services

Businesses using the WhatsApp Business API can showcase and share their products and services with customers for them to browse items and add to a cart without leaving the chat. To use the API for commerce use cases, follow these guides:

1. [**Upload inventory to Meta**](/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/sell-products-and-services/upload-inventory): Upload the business's inventory to Meta using the API or the [Meta Commerce Manager](https://business.facebook.com/commerce/).
2. [**Connect an Ecommerce Catalog to the WABA**](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/158662536425974): Connect a catalog that has been categorized as **Ecommerce** to the WhatsApp Business Account.
3. [**Set Commerce Settings**](/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/sell-products-and-services/set-commerce-settings): Set the business phone number's commerce settings.
4. [**Share Products With Customers**](/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/sell-products-and-services/share-products): Use Multi and Single Product Messages to send products to customers.
5. [**Receive Responses From Customers**](/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/sell-products-and-services/receive-responses): Track webhooks to get questions and orders from customers.

## Policies

Never send messages that violate our Commerce and Business Policies. Additionally, Multi and Single Product Messages are subject to the existing enforcement and data sharing rules for product catalogs:

* Rejection at product catalog level: WhatsApp automatically reviews items added to a catalog connected to a WABA. If a policy violating item is added, the product is flagged and the business is directed to the WhatsApp Commerce Policies.
* Reporting options for the user at the product catalog level: Users can report a specific product they receive via message. If a user reports a product, it gets reviewed for violations.

Businesses can appeal for disapproved items directly in the [Meta Commerce Manager](https://business.facebook.com/commerce/).
