# Group management

## Overview

The Groups API gives you simple functions to control groups through their lifecycle.

When you create a new group, an invite link is created for inviting participants to the group.

Since you cannot manually add participants to the group, simply send a message with your invite link to WhatsApp users who you would like to join the group.

## Group management features

* [Create and delete group](#create-group)
* [Groups with join requests enabled](#groups-with-join-requests)
* [Get and reset group invite link](#get-and-reset-group-invite-link)
* [Send group invite link template message](#send-group-invite-link-template-message)
* [Remove group participants](#remove-group-participants)
* [Get group info](#get-group-info)
* [Get active groups](#get-active-groups)
* [Update group settings](#update-group-settings)

To learn how to message groups, view the [Group Messaging reference](/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/groups/groups-messaging).

## Subscribe to groups metadata webhooks

In order to receive webhook notifications for metadata about your groups, please subscribe to the following webhook fields:

* `group_lifecycle_update`
* `group_participants_update`
* `group_settings_update`
* `group_status_update`

For a full reference of webhooks for the Groups API, please visit our [Webhooks for Groups API reference](/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/groups/webhooks).

## Create group

Use this endpoint to create a new group and generate a group invite link.

Once the group is created, you will receive a webhook with an `invite_link` parameter that contains an invite link for the group. You can send this invite link to WhatsApp users interested in joining the group.

Optionally, you can create a group that requires join approval. This means that if a WhatsApp user wants to join your group, you can approve or reject their request.

[Learn more about groups with join requests enabled](#groups-with-join-requests).

### Request syntax

Create a group with an initial group invite link:

`POST /<BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID>/groups`

### Request body

```
{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "subject": "<GROUP_SUBJECT>",
  "description": "<GROUP_DESCRIPTION>",
  "join_approval_mode": "<JOIN_APPROVAL_MODE>"
}
```

### Request parameters

| Placeholder | Description | Sample Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID>`  *String* | **Required**  Business phone number ID. | `12784358810` |
| `<GROUP_SUBJECT>`  *String* | **Required**  Group subject.  Maximum 128 characters. Whitespace is trimmed. | `New Purchase Inquiry` |
| `<GROUP_DESCRIPTION>`  *String* | **Optional**  Group description.  Maximum 2048 characters. | `Jim, an existing client, would like to learn about new car purchase options for current year models.` |
| `<JOIN_APPROVAL_MODE>`  *String* | **Optional**  Indicates if WhatsApp users who click the invitation link can join the group with or without being approved first.  Values can be:   * `approval_required`  Indicates WhatsApp users must be approved via [join request](#groups-with-join-requests) before they can access the group. * `auto_approve`  Indicates WhatsApp users can join the group without approval.   If omitted, `join_approval_mode` is set to `auto_approve` by default. | `auto_approve` |

### Webhooks

A `group_lifecycle_update` webhook is triggered.

#### Group create succeed

#### Group create fail

#### User joins group using invite link

## Groups with join requests

You can create groups that require join request approval. Once enabled, WhatsApp users who click the group invitation link can submit a request to join the group, or cancel a prior request:

When a WhatsApp user joins the group using a join request, a [`group_participants_update` webhook for a user accepting the join request] (/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/groups/webhooks#user-accepts-or-cancels-join-request) is triggered. You can also [get a list of open join requests via API](#get-join-requests). Use the contents of the webhook or API response to approve or reject requests.

## Get and reset group invite link

Once an invite link is reset, all previous invite links will become invalid.

An invite link for the group is generated when the group is created. Use these endpoints to get and reset group invite links.

For each endpoint, you will need your group ID in order to get or reset a link for the correct group as follows:

| Placeholder | Description | Sample Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<GROUP_ID>`  *String* | **Required**  The ID of the group you want to get or reset an invite link for. | `Y2FwaV9ncm91cDoxOTUwNTU1MDA3OToxMjAzNjMzOTQzMjAdOTY0MTUZD` |

`GET /<GROUP_ID>/invite_link`

#### Response body

```
{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "invite_link": "https://chat.whatsapp.com/<LINK_ID>"
}
```

Note that `invite_link` always begins with the prefix `https://chat.whatsapp.com/`. The only variable portion is `<LINK_ID>`.

### Reset group invite link

#### Request syntax

`POST /<GROUP_ID>/invite_link`

#### Request body

```
{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
}
```

## Send group invite link template message

[Template Library](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/template-library) contains a utility message template for sending group invite links to WhatsApp users. Use these pre-defined templates to send group invitations as utility messages.

**In order to keep the template priced as `utility`, you cannot modify it when you copy it from template library to your WABA.**

To send the template message:

#### Step 1. Add a group invite link template in Template Library to your account templates:

*In WhatsApp Manager*

1. Navigate to [Template Library](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/template-library)
2. On the left, click the **Group invite link** dropdown, then click the **Group invite upon request** checkbox.
3. Select the template you want to use, give it a name, and click **Submit**.

*Via the API*

You can query template libraries applicable to group invite links using the request below:

`GET /message_template_library?category=utility&topic=group_invite_link&language=en`

Template approval may require up to 24 hours. Youll be able to send messages with this template after its approval.

#### Step 2. Send the template message

1. Send the template using the request syntax and body below, substituting your group id, the name you gave your template, and other applicable values.

When you provide the group id in the api request, it will be automatically translated into the corresponding group invite link upon message delivery.

### Request syntax

`POST /<BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID>/messages`
