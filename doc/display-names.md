# Display names

You must provide a display name when [registering](#registering-business-phone-numbers) a business phone number. The display name appears in your business phone number's WhatsApp profile:

It can also appear at the top of **individual chat** threads and the **chat list** if your business phone number is approved via [display name verification](#display-name-verification). Note that if a WhatsApp user edits your profile name in the WhatsApp client, the name they set will appear instead.

## Display name guidelines

See our [Display name guidelines for the WhatsApp Business Platform](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/757569725593362) Help Center article for naming guidelines.

## Display name verification

When you reach a [higher messaging limit](/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits), your business phone number's display name will automatically undergo verification based on our [display name guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/757569725593362). When we complete the process, a [phone\_number\_name\_update](/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/webhooks/reference/phone_number_name_update) webhook and Meta Business Suite notification will be triggered.

If your display name is approved, the webhook will have `decision` set to `APPROVED`, and we will set the `name_status` field on your business phone number to `APPROVED`.

If your display name is rejected, the webhook will have `decision` set to `REJECTED`, and we will set the `name_status` field on your business phone number to `DECLINED`. If your name is rejected, we recommend that you re-review our [display name guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/757569725593362) and [edit your display name](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/378834799515077) accordingly, or file an appeal via [Developer Support](/docs/whatsapp/support#developer-support) or [Enterprise Developer Support](/docs/whatsapp/support#enterprise-developer-support).

## Viewing display name in WhatsApp Manager

Your business phone number's display name appears in the **Name** column in the [WhatsApp Manager](https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/) > **Account tools** > **Phone numbers** panel.

## Getting display name and display name status via API

Request the `verified_name` and `name_status` field on your WhatsApp Business Phone Number ID to get its display name and display name status. See the [GET /<WHATSAPP\_BUSINESS\_PHONE\_NUMBER\_ID>](/docs/graph-api/reference/whats-app-business-account-to-number-current-status/#Reading) reference for a list of returnable values and their meanings.

Note that the `verified_name` value does not indicate if the display name is approved or not, it just represents the display name string that will undergo verification when eligible. The `name_status` field indicates its approval status.

### Example request

```
curl 'https://graph.facebook.com/v24.0/106540352242922?fields=verified_name%2Cname_status' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer EAAJB...'
```

### Example response

Upon success:

```
{
  "verified_name": "Lucky Shrub",
  "name_status": "APPROVED",
  "id": "106540352242922"
}
```

## Updating display name via WhatsApp Manager

To update your display name via WhatsApp Manager:

1. Navigate to [WhatsApp Manager](https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/) > **Account tools** > **Phone numbers**.
2. Select your business phone number.
3. Click the **Profile** tab.
4. In the **Display name** section, click the **Edit** button and complete the flow.

Once you complete the flow, your display name will undergo [display name verification](#display-name-verification) again.

This information is also available in our [How to change your WhatsApp Business display name](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/378834799515077) Help Center article.

## Updating display name via API

Use the [POST /<WHATSAPP\_BUSINESS\_PHONE\_NUMBER\_ID>](/docs/graph-api/reference/whats-app-business-account-to-number-current-status/#Updating) endpoint's `new_display_name` field to update your display name via API.

### Example request

```
curl -X POST 'https://graph.facebook.com/v24.0/106540352242922?new_display_name=Lucky%20Shrub' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer EAAJB...'
```

### Example response

Upon success:

```
{
  "success": true
}
```

Upon success, your display name will undergo [display name verification](#display-name-verification). If you want to check the verification status, request the `new_display_name` and `new_name_status` fields on your business phone number ID:

### Example request

```
curl 'https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/106540352242922?fields=new_display_name,new_name_status' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer EAAJB...'
```

### Example response

Upon success:

```
{
  "new_display_name": "New Lucky Shrub",
  "new_name_status": "PENDING_REVIEW",
  "id": "106540352242922"
}
```

If your newly updated display name is approved, your business phone number's `verified_name` and `name_status` fields will be updated to reflect your new display name and name status, and **phone\_number\_name\_update** webhooks will be triggered.
