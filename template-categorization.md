# Template categorization

When creating a new template, or managing existing ones, it's important to understand how WhatsApp categorizes your template for pricing purposes.

1. Consider template category guidelines before creating a new template
2. Stay updated on your template's approval status after template creation
3. Learn about automatic category updates to templates in production

## Template category guidelines

Our template category guidelines define the category of message templates. Message templates can be categorized as:

* **Marketing templates** – Enable businesses to achieve a wide range of goals, from generating awareness to driving sales and retargeting customers.
* **Utility templates** – Enable businesses to follow up on user actions or requests, since these messages are typically triggered by user actions.
* **Authentication templates** – Enable businesses to verify a user’s identity, potentially at various steps of the customer journey.

### Marketing template guidelines

Marketing templates are the most flexible. They enable businesses to achieve a wide range of goals, from generating awareness to driving sales and more.

*Note: Examples are illustrative only. Templates that contain similar content, or the example text above, might be categorized differently based on the exact content.*

#### Message Objective: **Awareness**

| Business Goal | Example Templates |
| --- | --- |

| Business Goal | Example Templates |

We look forward to continuing to serve you. * Hello, I am the new {{virtual\_assistant}}. I can help you discover products or provide support. Please reach out if I can help! |

The following templates are also considered marketing:

* Templates with mixed content (for example, both utility and marketing, such as an order update with a promo or a feedback survey with promotional content).
* Templates where contents are unclear (for example, where contents are only “{{1}}” or “Congratulations!”).

### Utility template guidelines

Utility templates are typically triggered by a user action or request. For a template to be categorized as utility, it needs to meet both criteria below:

* *Must* be **non-promotional**, not containing any promotional or persuasive intent.
* *Must* ALSO be either **specific to or requested by the user** (clearly related to their order, account, services or transactions) OR **essential or critical** to the user (for example, to ensure user safety).

#### Message Objective: **Opt-In Management on WhatsApp**

I see you requested support via our {{online\_chat}}. I am the virtual assistant on WhatsApp. How can I help? * Hi {{name}}, we are following up on your call with customer service on {{issue}}.

### Authentication template guidelines

**Only authentication templates can be used to send a one-time passcode for identity verification. Marketing and utility templates cannot be used for this purpose.**

Businesses on Cloud API can use authentication templates from [Template Library](/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-message-templates/template-library).

Authentication templates enable businesses to verify user identity (usually with alphanumeric codes) at various steps of the customer journey:

* New account creation
* Account integrity, access or recovery
* New or existing orders/transactions

Authentication templates are our most restrictive, so for a template to be classified as authentication, **a business must**:

* Use Cloud API authentication message templates in [Template Library](/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-message-templates/template-library): These templates include optional add-ons like security disclaimers and expiry warnings.
* Configure a one-time password button: Such as [copy-code](/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/authentication-templates/copy-code-button-authentication-templates) or [one-tap](/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/authentication-templates/autofill-button-authentication-templates)
* Follow content restrictions: URLs, media, and emojis are not allowed for authentication template content or parameters. Parameters are also restricted to 15 characters.

#### Message Objective: **Authentication**

| Business Goal | Example Templates |
| --- | --- |
| Authenticate users with one-time passcodes | * "{{1}} is your verification code." * "{{1}} is your verification code. For your security, do not share this code." * "{{1}} is your verification code. This code expires in 15 minutes." |

## How we assign a category during template creation

When you create a template, you indicate the template's category, based on the guidelines above. We validate the category you indicated per the contents of the template and our [guidelines](#template-category-guidelines). We will then create the template and set its status to one of the statuses below, based on the outcome of the validation process.

a. When you create a template and we approve it, you can request a review up to 60 days from the creation date.

b. For utility templates we might update to marketing, you can request a review up to 60 days from the date we updated the category.

### Approved status

`APPROVED` status means we agree with the category chosen in your template creation request and that the template successfully passed [template review](/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/message-templates#template-review). It can now be used to send messages.

**Status updates** — An email and WhatsApp Manager alert will inform you that the template was approved, and a [message\_template\_status\_update](/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/webhooks/reference/message_template_status_update) webhook will be triggered with the event property set to `APPROVED`.

Effective April 9, 2025, If you selected `UTILITY` as the template’s category and we determine it should be `MARKETING`, **we approve the template as `MARKETING`**. In WhatsApp Manager, you will see the screen below. When using the API, the behavior will be as outlined above. You can request a review up to 60 days from the date we updated the category.

![](https://scontent.fcgb9-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/489819773_1204274457885205_9034566102399816972_n.png?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=iTndyBE8pDsQ7kNvwEcpZGz&_nc_oc=AdmLol96EczqUje3GvGQUcgt8zY6-ITafBPwjlvaqJ2SrUe_6mAOfEqBt9iPN2VA69A&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent.fcgb9-1.fna&_nc_gid=YIjQ2Zf8QYCh886aA3HYxg&oh=00_Afi1GcxOmp4VTnRQZEtW9ljOx4vn5djtCJVt8Gqf7LihcA&oe=69407DA8)

Effective April 9, 2025 – We no longer support the `allow_category_change` property during template creation. Previously, if set to `true` in a template creation request, this allowed us to update a template’s category to `marketing`, if we determined `marketing` to be its category per its content and our guidelines. This is now the default behavior.

### Pending status

`PENDING` status means we agree with the category chosen in your template creation request, however the template is undergoing [template review](/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/message-templates#template-review).

**Status Alerts** — The outcome of template review will be communicated via email and WhatsApp Manager alert. Upon completion, a [message\_template\_status\_update](/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/webhooks/components#message-template-updates) webhook will be triggered with the event property set to `APPROVED` or `REJECTED`.

### Rejected status

`REJECTED` status indicates that we disagreed with the category you designated in your template creation request.

**Status Alerts** — Rejections are communicated via email and WhatsApp Manager alert. Upon review completion, a [message\_template\_status\_update](/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/webhooks/reference/message_template_status_update) webhook will be triggered and the `event` property set to `REJECTED`, with the `reason` property set to `INCORRECT_CATEGORY`.

If your message template is rejected, you have the following options:

* [Create a new message template](/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/message-templates/) via WhatsApp Manager or the API.
* [Edit the template's category](/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/message-templates/template-management#edit-templates), and resubmit for approval.
* [Request a review](#how-to-request-a-category-review).

### Duplicated Templates from Phone Number Migration

All eligible templates are automatically duplicated in the destination WABA and category checks will be performed to ensure that all duplicated templates are correctly categorized.

## How we update a template's category after initial approval

July 1, 2024 — To ensure templates on our platform are correctly categorized per our template category guidelines, we introduced a recurring process to identify and update approved templates that should be of a different category, per our template category guidelines.

Effective April 16, 2025 — For any business we detect to be abusing our template categorization system and to whom [we send a warning](#notices-when-action-is-taken), we will no longer provide the 24-hour notice mentioned below if we detect a utility template that should be marketing. We will update the category with no advance notice and trigger emails/webhooks to confirm the category change

Automatic category updates can apply to approved templates only that were not initially approved per our template category guidelines. We provide advance notice on different surfaces, like through webhook and email, before we take action on these templates.

Read on to learn specifics about how we handle this process.

### **How it works**

### For templates approved as **utility**, but should actually be **marketing**

* **Notice period** — We provide 1-day advance notice before **the template category is updated to `marketing`**.
* **As of April 16 2025 — If you are warned for template categorization misuse:**
* 24 hour notice **will not** be provided before changing template categories from `UTILITY` to `MARKETING`
* Category changes will be **instant**
* **Template category** — The template category is changed to `MARKETING`
* **Template status** — There is no change to template status; it remains `APPROVED` and can continue to be used to send messages.

### For templates approved as **marketing or utility**, but should actually be **authentication**

*This process was introduced on October 1, 2024*

* **Notice period** — We provide advance notice.
* **Template category** — There is no change in the template’s category.
* **Template status** — On the first day of the following month, the template status is changed to `REJECTED` and can no longer be used to send messages.

Request the `category` and `correct_category` fields, which will return the IDs of all of the WABA's templates, and each template's `category` and `correct_category` values. You can then compare these values:

```
GET /<WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ID>/message_templates?fields=category,correct_category
```

* If the values match (for example, they are both `MARKETING`), the template's category has already been updated with the `correct_category` value.
* If they mismatch and the `correct_category` is not an empty string or null (for example, category is `UTILITY` but `correct_category` is `MARKETING`), the template's category will be updated on the first day of the next month with the `correct_category` value.
* If the `correct_category` value is an empty string or null, the template has not been impacted.

### Via WhatsApp Manager

The WhatsApp Manager's Manage Templates panel identifies any templates whose categories will be updated.

## How to update a template category or request a category review

This process has been in effect since June 2023, when we introduced our marketing, utility and authentication template categories.

### Edit your template's category

#### Via API

You can [edit template content or just its category](/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/message-templates/template-management#edit-templates).

* The template will undergo category validation and template review again.
* If the template passes validation and review, its category will be updated and a [template\_category\_update](/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/webhooks/reference/template_category_update) webhook webhook will be triggered.
* The `new_category` property in the webhook payload will indicate its new category.

#### Via WhatsApp Manager

On the **Manage Templates** tab:

1. Select your template
2. Edit the content so it aligns to the guidelines of that category
3. Re-submit the template for approval

If the template passes validation and review, its category will be updated and a [template\_category\_update](/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/webhooks/reference/template_category_update) webhook webhook will be triggered. The `new_category` property in the webhook payload will indicate its new category.

### Qualifications and outcomes for category review:

You can request Meta to review the category of your template if:

* It is categorized as `UTILITY` or `MARKETING` and status is `REJECTED`
* It is categorized as `MARKETING` and status is `APPROVED`

Possible outcomes after you submit a request of your template’s category:

* Review is approved – The category will be updated. A [template\_category\_update](/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/webhooks/reference/template_category_update) webhook webhook will be triggered. The `new_category` property in the webhook payload will indicate its new category.
* Review is rejected – The category will not change.

### How to request a category review

A review can only be requested via WhatsApp Manager.

In the sidebar of WhatsApp Manager, select the **Message Templates** dropdown, and then **Message Templates**. You should see a rejection banner with the template in question. Click **Go to Business Support**.

Click **Template Category Updates**, select the templates you would like reviewed and then click the **Request Review** button to begin the review process.

### How to view templates submitted for review:

In the Business Support sidebar, click **Template category Updates**, and then the **In review** tab.

![](https://scontent.fcgb9-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/572387663_1526245828599114_7926518049472866948_n.png?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=-Tc3Dxchc4EQ7kNvwFgwwqb&_nc_oc=AdmChNF3x3vqc4q7W4ZmlpAKSMHujsQGkvA8kWZrqfoPemCUW5kWfQBcDdTPGld-XjQ&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent.fcgb9-1.fna&_nc_gid=YIjQ2Zf8QYCh886aA3HYxg&oh=00_AfilphHAI-eTBIe_4JiL-8kQjohZWxbaalls-hL2T1PvGg&oe=694057CD)

### How to view template category decisions

**If the template category change is not approved**: The template can be viewed in Business Support under the **Template category updates** > **Unchanged** tab. The template’s category will change to the correct category during an automatic category update.

![](https://scontent.fcgb9-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/573009027_1027592439465357_7694481853741097993_n.png?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=Uzjx4ro0DncQ7kNvwEy9fY-&_nc_oc=AdlNEXq_WKUCJL-N2qRrtCXSbzlyDOC1qkKWH6EHj9jFy9E79pcZcu69aHiUIBMlc6g&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent.fcgb9-1.fna&_nc_gid=YIjQ2Zf8QYCh886aA3HYxg&oh=00_Afg245jvlvaqyA7gUg5DAdh89IXzWVLVDeLqjZlwnmgo5A&oe=694069F7)

**If the template category change is approved**: the template can be viewed in Business Support under the **Template category updates** > **Reversed** tab. If the template category was already changed during automatic category update, it will be reverted to its previous category.

![](https://scontent.fcgb9-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/571328611_1163046995205850_3257703726786671993_n.png?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=TTlx88iZsNsQ7kNvwEXCj0R&_nc_oc=AdlmM3X_oIaE_CRvUtZs2AFzuZGeV86pStTrkFoTn2fmoJpU6fBAm8DSit6_-f0Y2AU&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent.fcgb9-1.fna&_nc_gid=YIjQ2Zf8QYCh886aA3HYxg&oh=00_Afj1DWqS7c5o2wEYt_Xv3PFTd2-q_L4l2SRfapc5TQ9vkQ&oe=694072D4)

## Restrictions on businesses misusing the template categorization system

### How it works

We provide written notice before we restrict businesses from using the WhatsApp Business Platform for utility messaging in the following way:

* **Warning** – If we detect a business is misusing our template categorization system to secure the utility category for templates that should be categorized as marketing, we will send a written warning before we restrict them from using utility messaging on the WhatsApp Business Platform.
* **As of April 16 2025 — After you are given a warning:**
* A 24 hour notice **will not be provided** before changing template categories from `UTILITY` to `MARKETING`
* Category changes will be **instant**
* **Restriction** – If we detect misuse after this warning, we will introduce the following restrictions which would prevent the WhatsApp Business Account from using the WhatsApp Business Platform for utility messaging for 7 days:
* **As of April 16 2025 — We will no longer reject all previously approved `UTILITY` templates. Instead, they will be re-categorized as `MARKETING`**
* For 7 days – Disable [category reviews](#how-to-request-a-category-review) for these templates
* For 7 days – Disable creation of new utility templates

**For businesses that have been restricted previously** — If we detect continued misuse of our template categorization system, we might re-introduce these restrictions for 30 days.

### Notices when action is taken

We trigger the following notices:

* **Warnings** – Email is sent to all WhatsApp Business Account admins (people with **Full control** of the WhatsApp Business Account). An `account_update` webhook will be sent out indicating utility restriction `WARN` for the WhatsApp Business Account.
* **Restrictions** – When we introduce or lift restrictions, email is sent to all WhatsApp Business Account admins (people with **Full control** of the WhatsApp Business Account). We also trigger a change to the `restriction_info` object in the `account_update` webhook.

### Your options in this process

Businesses that believe we have applied these restrictions in error can request a review via [Business Support](https://business.facebook.com/business-support-home/).
